# ShadowArt: Augmented Shadowgraphy Art
 The project presents a real-time shadowgraphy imitation system called ShadowArt. Using an inexpensive camera, our system tracks handsâ€™ gestures and motions, then renders the hand silhouettes on screen with shadow effect in real time. Our system is easy to set up and only needs a mounted camera to achieve hand shadow imitations. ShadowArt can enhance shadow rendering and add animation effects when using additional Leap Motion sensor. This prototype system applies computer vision techniques to traditional shadowgraphy art with extra freedom of interaction and expression. It could be used in a variety of applications including education and artistic animation.
